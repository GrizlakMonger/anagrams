I think the current "wordlist" might be a parsed form of one of the lists that kept semantic roots together.
I've removed British spellings where I can find them (eg colour, spectre)


amphitheatre
amphitheatres

many words with centre, metre, litre,
(-tre instead of -ter in American English)

(-ise instead of -ize (realise) or -ice (practise)
acclimatise

removed some other British (offensive words): wog

(all in change log)
