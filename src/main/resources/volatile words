Volatile Words



AEST (19)
insight: this word has one of the highest anagram counts for a 4 letter word,
so even before another tile is flipped it can be volatile.
HOWEVER, seeing that its also extremely volatile to future flips, it
is probably NOT worth trying to hard to secure it (other than to exhaust
the base words to avoid future steals- even though these words don't have many derivations - seated, sated, seats, sates
some of these derivations themselves can be blocked by claiming "sate" - sated, sates)

Notable Patterns
 many words that end in are also have valid words with are (dale, dare, bale, bare etc)
and also deal, dear, seal sear

Rather than alphabetically sorting, I think 4 tile words
become more apparent when I group by vowels and consonants.
The most common division is two vowels and two consonants.

When it comes to volatility, having A and E in a word
tends to allow for the most wet word on its own and most potent word for futures.
