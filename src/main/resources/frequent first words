I could find how many vowel combos go with each consonant pair for 4 letter words
most common consonants ReTurN SuD  (RTNSD)

also good for considerations
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics
knowing what consontant clusters are possible
str-


'a' and 'i' usually are adjacent in small words that contain both: 'ia' 'ai'.
We often have '-air'  '-ail'.
A few exceptions arid, lira (note that foreign words will usually be the ones to have CvCv when vv = ai/ia.


simluations
DV
dive vied

MT
mote tome
item time emit mite
omit

NN
nine
naan

ST
suit


most likely consonant starts:
RR
RT
RN
RS
RD 48s

TT
TN
TS
TD

NN 9
NS 61
ND 41

SS
SD

DD 10



other ideas for 4 letter mastery
st - ts
sp - ps
pl - lp
these combos can appear at the start or middle of a word, or the end of a word with s last.



good to know:
aeon (only one consonant)
oboe (only one consonant)


if an s is out, start looking for 3 letter word possibilities.



do we count "frat" for fraternity, "teen" for teenager?
